GTA KiddionsMod Bunker Mission Automater
> Inspired by: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/329379-automating-kiddions-modest-menu-minimum-job-payout-blow-ii.html


# Setup:

* Add a custom location of your bunker laptop _(make sure youre in a position where the popup for sitting in the seat will show up)_
* Add a custom location of your Bunker trigger point _(I did this by running into the trigger and spamming 'add location')_
* Sell Bunker Stock manually once or twice _(the mod menu does this annoying thing where on the first sell, the delivery price increases at a higher rate than usual, so it breaks the timings)_

_**IMPORTANT: THE CUSTOM LOCATIONS MUST BE IN THE ORDER THEY ARE LISTED** (You can edit the teleports.json file in the mod menu directory to change the order of custom locations)_


# Running the script:

* Enter your Bunker _(stay where you are)_
* Open the mod menu and navigate to the Teleport section (leave the 1st option highlighted)
* Run the "KMBM Auto v0.4.py" and tab into the game
* Enjoy stonks :)
