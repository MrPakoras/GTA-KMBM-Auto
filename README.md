GTA KiddionsMod Bunker Mission Automater

# Setup:

> Add a custom location of your bunker laptop _(make sure youre in a position where the popup for sitting in the seat will show up)_
> Add a custom location of your Bunker trigger point _(I did this by running into the trigger and spamming 'add location')_

# Running the script:

> Enter your Bunker _(stay where you are)_
> Open the mod menu and navigate to the Teleport section (leave the 1st option highlighted)
> Run the script and tab into the game
> Enjoy stonks :)
